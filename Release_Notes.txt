( * - not changed)


 JOB script changes:
   JCDAS_DUMP, JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - Changed all "date" commands to "date -u" since WCOSS should always
      present date in UTC.
    - Obtains obsproc_global, obsproc_dump and obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist
      version numbers via imported environment variables $obsproc_global_ver,
      $obsproc_dump_ver and obsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist_ver, resp.
      These are defined in the upstream ecflow script.
    - Full environmental equivalence.  Streamlined, allows for more
      generalization (e.g., for checkout runs).
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_dump which points to
      directory path for generic dump subdirectories under version control
      (in production this is normally /nwprod/obsproc_dump.$obsproc_dump_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in exec, fix and ush
      directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_network which points to
      directory path for network-specific dump subdirectories under version
      control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_global.$obsproc_global_ver).  Replaces /nw${envir} in
      order to point to files in parm directory moved from horizontal to
      vertical directory structure.
    - Exports new environment variables $HOMEobsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist and
      $FIXobsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist which point to directory path for
      bufr_dumplist fixed file under version control (in production the latter
      is normally
   /nwprod/obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.$obsproc_shared_bufr_dumplist_ver/fix).
      Replaces /nw${envir}/fix from old horizontal directory structure.
   JCDAS_DUMP:
    - Uses "cp -p" rather than "cp when copying files to /com/arkv directory
      in order to preserve group ownership as "rstprod" for restricted files.
   JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - Exports new directory path variables for additional ice and sst files.

 Model script changes:
   exglobal_dump.sh.ecf:
    - $USHobsproc_dump replaces $utilscript as the environment variable
      representing the directory path to the ush script check_tanks.sh.
    - Modified to now dump OSCAT scatterometer data in "oscatw" using a time
      window of -3.00 to +2.99 hours relative to cycle time for the CDAS, GDAS
      and GFS.
      BENEFIT: GFS/GDAS parallel runs are now looking at these data.
    - Modified to skip the dumping of NeXRaD VAD winds from level 2 decoder
      (type 002, subtype 017) as part of the "vadwnd" dump ["vadwnd" will still
      contain only NeXRaD VAD winds from radar coded message (type 002, subtype
      008) for now].
      BENEFIT: The default is to now include NeXRaD VAD winds from the level 2
               decoder in the "vadwnd" dump file (as they will be used in the
               FY14Q2 NAM bundle).  The Global GSI cannot handle these at this
               time.
    - Modified to turn off the check for the existence of "wndsat" data tanks
      and thus any attempt to dump these data..
      BENEFIT: The WindSat scatterometer data ingest feed is currently broken
               as these data are now being produced under a new format that
               NCEP does not recognize.  As we transition to the new feed,
               we do not want to inadvertently dump these data in operations.
    - Modified to pick up additional ice, sst, and snow files .
      BENEFIT: GFS/GDAS parallel runs are now looking at these data.

 Parm file changes:
   prepobs_prepssmi.cdas.parm, prepobs_prepssmi.gdas.parm,
   prepobs_prepssmi.gfs.parm:
    - No changes to contents.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   Jobs JCDAS_DUMP, JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - creates new dump files
      /com/$NET/prod/$RUN.$PDY/$model.t${cyc}z.oscatw.tm00.bufr_d ,
      where cyc= 00, 06, 12, 18; NET= cdas and model= cdas for RUN= cdas;
      NET= gfs and model= gdas1 for RUN= gdas; and NET= gfs and model= gfs for
      RUN= gfs
    - "ascatw" dump files will now contain scatterometer winds from METOP-B (as
      well as from METOP-A from before)
   Job JCDAS_DUMP:
    - users in the "rstprod" group will now be able to read restricted dump
      files in the /com/arkv directory.
  

 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   Jobs JCDAS_DUMP, JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - the "ascatw" dump files will now be approximately twice as large
      since they will now include METOP-B (as well as METOP-A from before)
         CDAS: ascatw increases from ~ 17 MBytes/day to ~ 34 MBytes/day
         GDAS: ascatw increases from ~ 17 MBytes/day to ~ 34 MBytes/day
         GFS:  ascatw increases from ~ 14 MBytes/day to ~ 28 MBytes/day
    - disk space required per day for all new output dump files is:
        cdas: oscatw   ~  88 MBytes
        gdas: oscatw   ~  87 MBytes
        gfs:  oscatw   ~  66 MBytes
        TOTAL:       ~   241 MBytes
    - disk space required per day for all new ice, sst & snow grib files is:
        gfs:  fields   ~ 172 MBytes
        gdas: fields   ~ 172 MBytes
        TOTAL:       ~   344 MBytes
    - 3 second increase in wallclock run time
    - uses code from obsproc_dump.v3.0.0
    - uses code from obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v1.0.0
    - no other changes


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   - Test production jobs JCDAS_DUMP, JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP.
   - All changes in this version (1.0.0) will be tested when the next version
     (1.1.0) is tested as part of the parallel-production test of the hourly
     GOES satellite winds.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   - The main user of this output is the CDAS, GDAS and GFS models.
   - No change in dissemination.
   - No change in archival on HPSS.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This must be implemented simultaneously with the implementations of
   obsproc_dump_monitor.v1.0.0, obsproc_dump.v3.0.0, obsproc_nam.v1.0.0,
   obsproc_rap.v1.0.0, obsproc_rtma.v1.1.0, obsproc_urma.v1.1.0,
   obsproc_satingest.v2.0.0, obsproc_shared/bufr_cword.v1.0.0 and
   obsproc_shared/bufr_dumplist.v1.0.0.

   It should be implemented PRIOR to NESDIS' promotion of their hourly GOES
   satellite winds to their production server,

   Please copy new file
   /meso/save/Dennis.Keyser/HOME/versions/obsproc_global.ver to
   /nwprod/versions.
