( * - not changed)


 JOB script changes:
   JCDAS_DUMP, JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP:
    - Placed into VS/EE for first time.
    - Obtains obsproc_global and obsproc_dump version numbers via imported
      environment variables $obsproc_global_ver and $obsproc_dump_ver, resp.
      These are defined in the upstream ecflow script.
    - Streamlined, allows for more generalization (e.g., for checkout runs).
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_dump which points to
      directory path for generic dump subdirectories under version control
      (in production this is normally /nwprod/obsproc_dump.$obsproc_dump_ver).
      Replaces /nw${envir} in order to point to files in exec, fix and ush
      directories moved from horizontal to vertical directory structure.
    - Exports new environment variable $HOMEobsproc_network which points to
      directory path for network-specific dump subdirectories under version
      control (in production this is normally
      /nwprod/obsproc_global.$obsproc_global_ver).  Replaces /nw${envir} in
      order to point to files in parm directory moved from horizontal to
      vertical directory structure.

 Parm file changes:
   prepobs_prepssmi.cdas.parm, prepobs_prepssmi.gdas.parm,
   prepobs_prepssmi.gfs.parm:
    - Placed into VS/EE for first time. No changes to contents.

 Model script changes:
   exglobal_dump.sh.ecf:
    - Placed into VS/EE for first time.
    - Modified to dump GOES IR, water vapor, and visible satellite-derived
      winds using a time window of -1.00 to -0.01 hours relative to cycle time
      for the CDAS, GDAS and GFS rather than -1.50 to +1.50 hours relative to
      cycle time.
      BENEFIT: NESDIS is changing the frequency of their GOES satellite
               derived winds from 3-hourly to 1-hourly. The change to
               exglobal_dump.sh.ecf will allow one complete wind set to
               continue to be dumped and assimilated (not changing the time
               window would triple the number of winds dumped and assimilated,
               all over the same locations). This change will also allow winds
               closer to cycle time to now be assimilated.
    - Modified to skip the dumping of NeXRaD VAD winds from level 2 decoder
      (type 002, subtype 017) as part of the "vadwnd" dump ["vadwnd" will still
      contain only NeXRaD VAD winds from radar coded message (type 002, subtype
      008) for now].
      BENEFIT: Although the NeXRaD VAD winds from level 2 decoder may not yet
               otherwise even be included in the "vadwnd" dump, this will
               happen in the FY14Q2 NAM bundle - the Global GSI cannot handle
               these at this time.

 ECF script changes:
   cdas/dump/jcdas_dump.ecf, gdas/dump/jgdas_dump.ecf, gfs/dump/jgfs_dump.ecf:
    - Placed into VS/EE.  Obtains versions for obsproc_global
      ($obsproc_global_ver) and obsproc_dump ($obsproc_dump_ver) from
      obsproc_global.ver file - both are now exported for use by JOB scripts
      JCDAS_DUMP, JGDAS_DUMP, and JGFS_DUMP
    - Generalized to handle all cycles.


 Output changes:
 ---------------
   No changes.


 Compute Resource Information:
 -----------------------------
   Jobs JCDAS_DUMP, JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP
    - uses code from obsproc_dump.v3.0.0
    - no other changes


 Preimplementation Testing Requirements:
 ---------------------------------------
   - Test production jobs JCDAS_DUMP, JGDAS_DUMP, JGFS_DUMP.
   - This is part of the parallel-production test of the hourly GOES satellite
     winds.


 Dissemination:
 --------------
   - The main user of this output is the CDAS, GDAS and GFS models.
   - No change in dissemination.
   - No change in archival on HPSS.


 Special Instructions:
 ---------------------
   This must be implemented at EXACTLY the same time as NESDIS' promotion of
   the hourly GOES satellite winds to their production server, and
   simultaneously with the implementations of obsproc_dump_monitor.v1.0.0,
   obsproc_dump.v3.0.0, obsproc_nam.v1.0.0, obsproc_rap.v1.0.0,
   obsproc_rtma.v1.1.0 and obsproc_utma.v1.1.0.
